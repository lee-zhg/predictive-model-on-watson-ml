# Deploy a model to predict heart failure with Watson Machine Learning

> **DISCLAIMER**: This application is used for demonstrative and illustrative purposes only and does not constitute an offering that has gone through regulatory review.

This code pattern can be thought of as two distinct parts:

1. A predictive model will be built using Spark within a Jupyter Notebook on IBM Watson Studio. The model is then deployed to the Watson Machine Learning service, where it can be accessed via a REST API.

2. A Node.js web app that allows a user to input some data to be scored against the previous model.

When the reader has completed this Code Pattern, they will understand how to:

* Build a predictive model within a Jupyter Notebook on Watson Studio
* Deploy the model to the IBM Watson Machine Learning service
* Via a Node.js app, score some data against the model via an API call to the Watson Machine Learning service

**Sample output**

Here's an example of what the final web app looks like

## Architecture

1. The developer creates an IBM Watson Studio Workspace.
2. IBM Watson Studio uses an Apache Spark service.
3. IBM Watson Studio uses Cloud Object storage to manage your data.
4. IBM Watson Studio uses a Jupyter Notebook to import data, train, and evaluate their model.
5. Data is imported and stored on Cloud Object Storage.
6. Models trained via Jupyter Notebooks are deployed using the Watson Machine Learning service.
7. A Node.js web app is deployed on IBM Cloud, it calls the predictive model hosted on the Watson Machine Learning service.
8. A user visits the web app, enters their information, and the predictive model returns a response.

### 1. Setup project and data in Watson Studio

To complete this code pattern we'll need to do a few setup steps before creating our model. In Watson Studio we need to: create a project, add our patient data (which our model will be based on), upload our notebook, and provision a Watson Machine Learning service.

#### 1.1. Create a project in Watson Studio

* Log into IBM's [Watson Studio](https://dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com). Once in, you'll land on the dashboard.

* Create a new project by clicking `+ New project` and choosing `Data Science and AutoAI`:

   ![studio project](doc/source/images/studio-project-ds.png)

* Choose a `Region`.

* Enter a name for the project name.

* Choose a `Storge` if you have more than one storage. If you don't have any yet, it'll create a new Storage for you.

* Choose a `Watson Machine Learning` instance if you have more than one. If you don't have any, it'll create a new instance for you.

* Click `Create`.

> **NOTE**: By creating a project in Watson Studio a free tier `Object Storage` service can be created in your IBM Cloud account. Select the `Free` storage type to avoid fees.

#### 1.2 Add patient data as an asset

The data used in this example was generated using a normal distribution. Attributes such as age, gender, heartrate, minutes of exercise per week, and cholesterol are used to create the model we will eventually deploy.

* From the new project `Overview` panel, click `+ Add to project` on the top right and choose the `Data` asset type.

   ![add asset](doc/source/images/add-assets-data.png)

* A panel on the right of the screen will appear to assit you in uploading data. Follow the numbered steps in the image below.

  * Ensure you're on the `Load` tab. [1]
  * Click on the `browse` option. From your machine, browse to the location of the `data/patientdataV6.csv` file in this repository, and upload it. [not numbered]
  * Once uploaded, go to the `Files` tab. [2]
  * Ensure the `patientdataV6.csv` appears. [3]

   ![add patient data](doc/source/images/add-patient-data.png)

* **TIP:** Once successfully uploaded, the file should appear in the `Data assets` section of the `Assets` tab.

   ![data asset](doc/source/images/data-asset.png)

#### 1.3 Provision a Watson Machine Learning service

This section has instruction for creating Watson Machine Learning service manually. You either created a new Watson Machine Learning service instance or selected an existing pone while you created a new project in Watson Studio.

If you don't know how to get credential of a Watson Machine Learning service instance, please read the rest of this section. Otherwise, you may skip this section and move on to the next section.

* Click on the navigation menu on the left (`☰`) to show additional options. Click on the `Watson Services` option.

   ![add asset](doc/source/images/hamburger-menu-watson.png)

* From the overview page, click `+ Add service` on the top right and choose the `Machine Learning` service. Select the `Lite` plan to avoid fees.

* Once provisioned, you should see the service listed in the `Watson Services` overview page. **Select the service by opening the link in a new tab.**  We're now in the IBM Cloud tool, where we will create service credentials for our now Watson Machine Learning service. Follow the numbered steps in the image below. **We'll be using these credentials in Step 2, so keep them handy!**.

   ![wml credentials](doc/source/images/wml-credentials.png)

* **TIP:** You can now go back the project via the navigation menu on the left (`☰`).

   ![add asset](doc/source/images/hamburger-menu-project.png)

#### 1.4 Create a notebook in Watson Studio

The notebook we'll be using can be viewed in [`notebooks/predictiveModel.ipynb`](notebooks/predictiveModel.ipynb), and a completed version can be found in [`examples/exampleOutput.ipynb`](examples/exampleOutput.ipynb).

* From the new project `Overview` panel, click `+ Add to project` on the top right and choose the `Notebook` asset type. Fill in the following information:

  * Select the `From URL` tab. [1]
  * Enter a `Name` for the notebook and optionally a description. [2]
  * Under `Notebook URL` provide the following url: [https://github.com/IBM/predictive-model-on-watson-ml/blob/master/notebooks/predictiveModel.ipynb](https://github.com/IBM/predictive-model-on-watson-ml/blob/master/notebooks/predictiveModel.ipynb) [3]
  * For `Runtime` select the `Default Spark Python 3.6 XS ......` option. [4]
  * Create Notebook.

  ![add notebook](doc/source/images/create-spark-notebook.png)

* **TIP:** Once successfully imported, the notebook should appear in the `Notebooks` section of the `Assets` tab.

  ![notebook asset](doc/source/images/notebook-asset.png)

### 2. Create and deploy a predictive model with Watson Studio

Now that we're in our Notebook editor, we can start to create our predictive model by stepping through the notebook.

![notebook viewer](doc/source/images/notebook-viewer.png)

#### 2.1 Step through the notebook and create a model (step 1-4 of the notebook)

* Click the `(►) Run` button to start stepping through the notebook. 

>  Note: You would click the `(►) Run` to execute each step in the notebook. If you had experience working in old notebook UI, there was an execution icon in the front of each step.

> In the front of each code section of notebook, if you found `[ ]`, the code has not been executed yet. If you found `[*]`, the code is being executed. If found `[number]`, the code execution was completed. The number is increased by 1 after each code section execution. Before you start executing the next code, be sure that the current code and all previous code sections have completed.

* When you reach the cell entitled `2. Load and explore data`, pause and follow the instructions in that cell. On the very next cell you need to add our data. Follow the numbered steps in the image below.

  ![stop on this cell](doc/source/images/insert-point.png)

  * Click on the `Data` icon. [1]
  * Select the `Insert to code` option under the file **patientdataV6.csv**. [2]
  * Choose the `Insert SparkSession Data Frame` option. [3]

  ![add spark dataframe](doc/source/images/insert-spark-dataframe.png)

* The above step will have inserted a chunk of code into your notebook. We need to make two changes:

  * Rename the `df_data_1` variable to `df_data`. [1]
  * Re-add the line `.option('inferSchema','True')\` to the `spark.read()` call. [2]

  ![modify automatic code](doc/source/images/spark-data-frame.png)

* Keep stepping through the code, pausing on each step to read the code and see the output for the opertion we're performing. 

* At the end of *Step 4*, we'll have used the [Random Forest Classifier from PySpark](https://spark.apache.org/docs/2.1.0/ml-classification-regression.html#random-forest-classifier) to create a model **LOCALLY**.

   ![model notebook eval](doc/source/images/model-notebook-eval.png)

#### 2.2 Save the model (step 5 of the notebook)

The gist of the next two steps is to use the [Watson Machine Learning Python client](https://wml-api-pyclient.mybluemix.net/) to persist and deploy the model we just created.

* At the beginning of Step *5. Persist model*, before we deploy our model, we need up update the cell with credentials from our Watson Machine Learning service. (Remember that from [Step 1.3 Provision a Watson Machine Learning service](#13-provision-a-watson-machine-learning-service)?)

* Update the `wml_credentials` variable below. Copy and paste the entire credential dictionary, which can be found on the _Service Credentials_ tab of the Watson Machine Learning service instance created on the IBM Cloud.

   ![credentials-in-nb](doc/source/images/credentials-in-nb.png)

* Keep stepping through the code, pausing on each step to read the code and see the output for the opertion we're performing. At the end of *Step 5* we'll have used the Watson Machine Learning service to persist our predictive model! :tada:

   ![created-saved-model](doc/source/images/created-saved-model.png)

#### 2.3 Deploy the model (step 6 of the notebook)

* Now let's run *Step 6* of the notebook. Deploy our model so we can have an endpoint to score data against.

  ![score-url-in-nb](doc/source/images/score-url-in-nb.png)

Now that we have an API, let's create a client side interface that a typical user would interact with.

<!-- this only works if we associate the service with the project, make this optional

* **TIP:** Once successfully imported, the notebook should appear in the `Models` section of the `Assets` tab. It will likely be named `Heart Failure Prediction Model`.

   ![model asset](doc/source/images/model-asset.png) -->

### 3. The client side

#### 3.1 Deploy the web app

You can deploy this application as a Cloud Foundry application to IBM Cloud by simply clicking the button below. This option will create a deployment pipeline, complete with a hosted Git lab project and devops toolchain.

<p align="center">
    <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/devops/setup/deploy?repository=https://github.com/IBM/predictive-model-on-watson-ml">
    <img src="https://cloud.ibm.com/devops/setup/deploy/button_x2.png" alt="Deploy to IBM Cloud">
    </a>
</p>

* You may be prompted for an *IBM Cloud API Key* during this process. Use the `Create (+)` button to auto-fill this field and the others.

   ![pipeline](doc/source/images/pipeline.png)

* Click on the `Deploy` button to deploy the application.

* You can view the URL where the app will live by either waiting for the deployment to finish, or by finding your app from the [IBM Cloud dashboard](https://cloud.ibm.com/resources).  or Click on the application name, then choose `Visit App URL` from the `Overview` page to open the application in a separate tab.

   ![open app](doc/source/images/open-app.png)

#### 3.2 Bind the app with the existing Maching Learning service

* From the application's overview page, select the `Connections` option from the left menu panel. This will allow us to associate our Watson Machine Learning service with the application. Find the Watson Machine Learning service (likely prefixed with `pm-20`), click the `Connect` button, and choose the default options for the IAM generated credentials. and select the Watson Machine Learning service you provisioned earlier.

  ![connect app](doc/source/images/connect-to.png)

* When prompted to restage your application click the `Restage` button. The app will take a couple of minutes to come back online. Refresh any web pages that have the app running.

> *Why do this?* The application is expecting information about the Maching Learning service via environment variables. By associating the application with the service, details about the service, such as the deployment id, and other sensitive information are accessible through environment variables.

#### 3.3 Interacting with the web app

The app is fairly self-explantory, simply fill in the data you want to score and click on the `Score now` button to test how those figures would score against our model.

* Verify that the model predicts that there is a risk of heart failure for the patient with these medical characteristics.

   ![risk](doc/source/images/failure-yes.png)

* Verify that the model predicts that there is not a risk of heart failure for the patient with these medical characteristics.

   ![no risk](doc/source/images/failure-no.png)
